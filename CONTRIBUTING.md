# Contributing Guidelines
## Issues and Feature Requests
We have bug report and feature request templates, please use those if it fits. If it already exists, please don't make a new one. Like or comment on it instead of adding a new bug.

## Pull Requests
I do not have a template yet. I will update this as soon as I can. I would like to see if there are best practices for code in PyPi.
